<h5 align="center">I identify myself as a transparent individual who takes responsibilities seriously and knows how to hustle. Giving attention to detail is one of my strongest traits while I also place strong emphasis on producing clean, quality and well documented code. I consider myself a really good team player who prioritizes the collective over my own self. I love to help others get better and equally like being mentored to improve myself. I'm currently associated with Xref, as a full-time Full Stack Engineer where my primary tasks include development and optimization of the company's software products. Apart from my technical knowhow, I have strong communication skills due to my blogging experience and I see myself equally capable when leading or being led. When I'm not doing coding. i like to interact with people.
